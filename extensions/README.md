# Extensions

An extension is an optional addition that sits beside the Standard without changing it.

- **Optional.** An extension's MUST, SHALL and SHOULD sentences bind only an implementation that says it uses that extension, at that version.
- **Beside the Standard.** An extension reads core fields and adds its own attachment. It does not change what a core field means or when it is required. Where an extension and the Standard's text disagree, the Standard's text governs.
- **Versioned on its own.** Each extension has its own version number and names the core release it was written against.
- **Not part of the Standard's releases.** Each extension version gets its own tag once it leaves Proposal, and a tagged version does not change. The Standard's release manifests and checksum lists do not include extensions.
- **No claims.** An extension says nothing about what any law requires. The records remain input, not evidence, and using an extension makes no one "certified", "compliant" or "approved".
